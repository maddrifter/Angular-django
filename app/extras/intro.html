<h4>ScrumDo Extras</h4>
<hr/>
<p>
    Our extras allow us to offer features not built into the core ScrumDo interface.  This includes things
    like third party integrations, custom solutions for specific customers, or experimental features for
    people to try.
</p>

<p>
    This page is for organization level integrations.  For <b>workspace-level integrations</b> such as card syncronization,
    see the settings page for a particular workspace.
</p>

<p>
    Extras are only available to customers with a premium subscription.
